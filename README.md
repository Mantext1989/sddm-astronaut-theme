# SDDM Astronaut Theme With Uppercase Username Support

This is a fork of the [sddm-astronaut-theme](https://github.com/Keyitdev/sddm-astronaut-theme) repository.

I created this fork because I want it to be able to input uppercase letters in username fields.

To use this fork, simply do:
```
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://github.com/Mantext1989/sddm-astronaut-theme/raw/refs/heads/master/setup.sh)"
```
